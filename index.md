OWASP-Cotonou Chapter aims
--------------------------

Benin is located in West Africa between Nigeria and Togo. At one time, in Benin, computer security was just a matter of science fiction, but in recent years there has been a craze for information system security issues through the creation of government agencies whose objective is to address security issues. In addition, universities that previously did not train security experts have begun to do so. E-services are deployed  in publics and private  administrations in all around the country.
The OWASP-Cotonou chapter aims to contribute to the awareness of software security issues in Benin through activities offered by the OWASP foundation.

Specifically, the enormous resources made available by the OWASP community around the world constitute an opportunity for public authorities, decision-makers, new graduates in terms of training, good practices and networking. Our mission and main priority is to use these resources to create cybersecurity awareness in Cotonou and Benin in general.
