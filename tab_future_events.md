The Chapter of the OWASP foundation, in partnership with the Information Systems and Digital Agency (ASIN), is organizing a 5-day training course from July 15 to 19, 2024 on the theme: awareness of information security. This training is intended for anyone who wishes to deepen their knowledge of IT security so as not to remain the weak link in their organization's security management system. Do not hesitate to register very quickly using the link on the poster (https://owaspformation.emes.bj/) because the number of places is very very limited.
